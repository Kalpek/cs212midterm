	<p1>Hey, while doing this project I know we were supposed to install ExpressJS onto our server, but I couldn't get it to install onto my Azure server.</p1><br><br>
	<p2>I emailed the professor, and he gave me a link to a guide on how to install nodeJs onto the Azure server, however</p2><br><br>
	<p3>The download link provided on that guide didn't run on my machine, saying "Failed to install Web Platform Instaler. Click OK to use the browser to download installer."</p3><br><br>
	<p4>I clicked OK, but it lead to a download.microsoft.com link with a 404 error code that the website no longer exists. Trying to google the new installation link, I couldn't find anything, even on the Azure website searchbar.</p4><br><br>
	<p5>Again, I'm not expecting special treatment for these issues but I got home hours before the assignment was due, now it's late and I really don't have time to attempt to make it work when I really don't know where to look.</p5><br><br>
	<p6>In the future I wish that if Azure is the standard for this course that the documentation for the assignments should reflect that, I tried using hostwinds in the beginning but they took my account down</p6><br>
	<p7>because my account was suspected of DDOSing a website even though I hadn't touched it besides when doing projects for this course.</p7><br><br>
	<p8>But yeah I just wanted to make clear what happened to whoever is grading this. Sorry again for the inconvenience</p8>
