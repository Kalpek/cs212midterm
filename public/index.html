<p>This project by far has taken me the longest to complete. I began immediately after finishing Lab 6, and its been a good few hours of trial and error. The biggest challenge was definitely the different paths between in game.</p>
<p>Creating and keeping track of the path without something freezing was more difficult than I thought it'd be for sure. I always felt like there was something I forgot, then when I felt like I had everything, something froze the page and I couldn't figure out why.</p>
<p>I chose a bridge game because of some mario party nostalgia, but it also just wasn't anything too crazy that still lead to a different outcome. Honestly the worst part about these back to back projects is that they were due on the same day, and I just so happen to be very sick. </p>
<p>But overall, it was enjoyable to finally get the end product I wanted.</p>
